    What is pydantic?

    Pydantic is a Python library for data modeling/parsing that has efficient error 
    handling and a custom validation mechanism. 
    
    As of today, Pydantic is used mostly in the FastAPI framework for parsing requests 
    and responses because Pydantic has built-in support for JSON encoding and decoding.
