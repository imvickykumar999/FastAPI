    What Is FastAPI?
    
    FastAPI is a modern, high-performance web framework for building APIs with 
    Python based on standard type hints. It has the following key features:

        Fast to run: It offers very high performance, 
        on par with NodeJS and Go, thanks to Starlette and pydantic.
        
        Fast to code: It allows for significant increases in development speed.
        
        Reduced number of bugs: It reduces the possibility for human-induced errors.
        
        Intuitive: It offers great editor support, 
        with completion everywhere and less time debugging.
        
        Straightforward: It’s designed to be uncomplicated to use and learn, 
        so you can spend less time reading documentation.
        
        Short: It minimizes code duplication.
        
        Robust: It provides production-ready code with automatic interactive documentation.
        
        Standards-based: It’s based on the open standards for APIs, OpenAPI and JSON Schema.

    What is pydantic?

    Pydantic is a Python library for data modeling/parsing that has efficient error 
    handling and a custom validation mechanism. 
    
    As of today, Pydantic is used mostly in the FastAPI framework for parsing requests 
    and responses because Pydantic has built-in support for JSON encoding and decoding.
